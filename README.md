The project focuses on feature engineering for Delhivery's logistics data to help improve forecasting models and data processing. The dataset consists of trip details, including origin, destination, time, and distance metrics. It involves cleaning and preprocessing data by handling missing values, converting date-time columns, and calculating various trip-related features. Additionally, the project uses aggregation techniques, outlier detection, and handling of categorical variables to refine the data for further analysis. Finally, recommendations are made to optimize the routing engine and address traffic disparities across different zones to improve logistics efficiency.
